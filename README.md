# Leaf classificator
Python app, in form of jupyter notebook, which can classify certain leafs. 
Used libraries:
* sklearn
* numpy
* matplotlib
* skimage

# Data
Classificator was trained and evaluated on a [subset](https://github.com/AronRynkiewicz/leaf_classificator/tree/master/leafsnap-subset1) of the [Leafsnap Dataset](http://leafsnap.com/dataset/).

# Description
First part of app processes images to extract features from them. Second part consists of selecting best classificator, tuning it's parameters and selecting vital features from the dataset.
Full app [report](https://github.com/AronRynkiewicz/leaf_classificator/blob/master/showcase/app_report.pdf) (in Polish) describes every step and provides reasoning why app has been written the way it has.
